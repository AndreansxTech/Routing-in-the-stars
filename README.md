## What is this repo?

This is **not a self-hosting lab** with NAS, media servers, etc.  
It’s a **network engineering learning lab** based on physical hardware and real-world configurations.  
Expect command-line configs, hand-drawn diagrams, technical breakdowns, and iterative scenarios.

This repo evolves as I grow – configs are wiped, topologies rebuilt, ideas retested. It’s a place for **experimentation**, not perfection.

## Learning Tracks

Here’s a breakdown of the networking areas I’m actively exploring and experimenting with:

### 1. Lab Infrastructure & Virtualization
> Getting the environment ready for hands-on learning

- Proxmox VE, Dell PowerEdge servers, backups, snapshots

### 2. VLANs & Layer 2 Switching
> Learning isolation, segmentation, and L2 communication

- 802.1Q tagging, trunks, access ports, SVIs

### 3. Layer 3 Concepts & Routing
> Understanding how traffic moves between subnets

- Static/dynamic routing, CIDR, route inspection

### 4. Addressing & Network Services
> Playing with the building blocks of communication

- MAC, ARP, DHCP, DNS, NAT, TFTP

### 5. Monitoring & Discovery
> Making the network observable and self-documenting

- SNMP, CDP, LLDP, syslog

### 6. Protocol Labs & Real-World Simulation
> Simulating realistic enterprise behaviors

- Multi-switch setups, failover tests, hybrid topologies

### 7. Certification Labs & Theory
> Working toward CompTIA Network+, MTCNA, and CCNA

- CLI practice, sandbox scenarios, concepts in action

## Plans for now

I’m currently studying for **CompTIA Network+**, while building lab scenarios using MikroTik and Brocade gear.  
I’m still in high school – but that gives me a great head start.

—

## The Goal

My goal is to become a professional **network engineer**.  
This lab helps me:

* Practice designing and troubleshooting real networks  
* Learn routing/switching protocols deeply  
* Prepare for certifications like Network+, MTCNA, and CCNA  
* Explore how real devices behave and fail
