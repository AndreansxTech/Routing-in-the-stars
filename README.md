# Hi ! Happy to see you visiting my Homelab project

## What is this about? 🧐
   This is a repository dedicated to documenting my journey with homelabing and general networking. I will upload the configuration files of my network hardware as well as servers configs and scripts if any will be made. 

## Start of the project
   Around the middle of October of 2024 I did my first step to creating a homelab. I bought two Dell PowerEdge servers: a R610 and a R710. </br>
## The goal 📈
   The current goal of this project is to simply learn by practically experimenting with physical hardware for my dream of working in network engineering in the future.
